An anomaly-detection system. Treat it as an industrial early-warning pipeline, not a toy ML model. The goal is a system that ingests recent weather observations and emits anomaly alerts per capital. 

Detecting 'anomaly' for example an extreme weather event or condition
Detect atmospheric outliers per region:
- pressure drops beyond expected ranges
- wind speed spikes
- humidity temperature inconsistencies
Focus: systems behavior, not outcome prediction.
Significance: useful for early-warning-like design, even though you're not forecasting.
